# Beaver Brewer Module Boilerplate #

This module is intended to be used as a boilerplate or starting point for your own Beaver Brewer module project. You will want to replace the module slug ('module-name') and class name ('ModuleName') wherever they occur, and edit the existing files to add in any functionality that you'd like to include. 

### Requirements ###
- [Wordpress](https://wordpress.org/) (obviously)
- The [Beaver Builder Wordpress Plugin](https://www.wpbeaverbuilder.com)
- The [Beaver Brewer (Homebrew Modules) Wordpress Plugin](http://beaverbrewer.com)

### How Do I Get Started? ###

Simply download the boilerplate and install it using [Beaver Brewer](http://beaverbrewer.com) (or manually place it inside your wp-content/bb-modules directory), then modify it as you see fit. Beaver Builder offers a guide to custom module development [here](https://www.wpbeaverbuilder.com/custom-module-documentation/).
